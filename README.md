<br/>Conata is a cyberpunk project from Japan, started by a single VR and social game developer. <br/>The service was created to create a metaverse society with NFT-first design principles. <br/>
<br/> Metaverse is not limited to VR, but also envisions a digital twin, a world where the concept of the virtual is integrated into the real world.　<br/> <BR/>

In the end, we will provide NFT sales and purchases and associated communication services in a virtual space based on blockchain.

## Why utilize dev protocol?
Conata in 2019-2021 has been developed with the enthusiasm and goodwill of a very small team.
At times, we have had to suspend our activities due to lack of time or funding.
In order to make our activities for the metaverse xNFT sustainable, we decided to use the Dev protocol.

We also believe that it is very important to be in touch with the dev protocol in order to realize a decentralized organization such as DAO.
This part is also very important.


## What I've done so far <br> 
NFT is cool. In order to visualize the idea that NFT is cool, we have been <br> 
In order to visualize that NFTs are cool, we have been publishing NFTs in virtual space and NFT culture in the form of songs and cartoons.

　<br> ### Create a society that gives back to creators <br> ### Create an environment where virtual creators can monetize their work. 
 
 
### Original System Priority Development <br> 
We will not invest too much in multi-functional systems that are provided by other services.

### I'll try not to get involved in the battle for disposable time. 
<br> ### We will not participate in the battle for disposable time as much as possible. <br> ### We will prioritize designing communication services that extend our time rather than real-time communication.　<br>

## Future Conata features to be developed <br> 
### My Room <br> 
　We plan to make it editable. Probably upload method <br> 

#### Allow users to develop their own services on their own domain (for corporations and billers) <br> 
#### Publish and manage NFTs for user-driven metaverse <br> 
　Upload virtual spaces, games and creations developed with Unity or UnrealEngine <br> 


How will the funds raised by ## DEV be used?

We will use the funds for the following purposes
　1) Securing human resources
　2) Legal and accounting
　(3) Development costs for the Conata service.
　
Particularly, item (3) is important because NFT lacks use cases that show how it can be used in reality. NFT is lacking in use cases.
Although we cannot generate short-term profits, we recognize that this is an activity that is essentially required.

At Conata, we have designed an NFT-first service.
