## What is Conata?

Conata is a cyberpunk project from Japan, started by a single VR and social game developer. <br/>
The service was created to create a metaverse society with NFT-first design principles. <br/>

<br/> Metaverse is not limited to VR, but also envisions a digital twin, a world where the concept of the virtual is integrated into the real world.　<br/> 

In the end, we will provide NFT sales and purchases and associated communication services in a virtual space based on blockchain. <br/>

### Data management for the multiverse <br> 
　→Develop a system that does not confine itself to one world, but allows other VR services to easily interconnect with each other via Web 3.0 in the future <br> 
 
### Digital Twin
　→Create a situation in which real-world goods, works, and rights can be tokenized and easily distributed. 

### NFT Token Graph
  → Originally, we thought that NFT would work well in solidly connecting fans and IPs, so we sympathized and developed it.
We will develop services that utilize NFT's unique token graph.

## Why utilize dev protocol?
Conata in 2019-2021 has been developed with the enthusiasm and goodwill of a very small team.
At times, we have had to suspend our activities due to lack of time or funding.
In order to make our activities for the metaverse xNFT sustainable, we decided to use the Dev protocol.

We also believe that it is very important to be in touch with the dev protocol in order to realize a decentralized organization such as DAO.
This part is also very important.


## Manifesto <br> 
### Create a society that gives back to creators <br> 
　We will support creators' creative activities and activities with our system. <br/>
 https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/2571　<br/>
　We will especially focus on creating an environment where virtual creators can monetize their work. 　<br/>
 
 
### Original system priority development
We will not invest too much in multi-functions and other services that are provided by other services.<br/>
We will invest our time and assets in building our own NFT-first system. We will invest our time and assets in building our own NFT-first system, and develop it if necessary.<br/>


### We will not participate in the battle for disposable time as much as possible.
Our priority is to design communication services that extend your time rather than real-time communication.<br/>


### Order and chaos, peace and love <br> 
We create chaos to enjoy waste rather than to create smart websites.　<br>

## Conata's World View　 <br> 
NFT is cool. In order to visualize that　<br/>
I've been publishing NFTs in virtual space, as well as songs and cartoons about NFT culture.　<br/>

I've been working on a nostalgic but slightly new project that adds the concepts of VR, Web3, and blockchain to the cyberpunk worldview that originated in Japan. We have been working on these activities.<br/>

Cartoons like this, settings, etc.　<br> 


## Future Conata features to be developed <br> 
#### NFT My Room <br> 
　We plan to make it editable. Probably upload method <br> 

#### Allow users to develop their own services on their own domain (for corporations and billers) <br> 
#### Publish and manage NFTs for user-driven metaverse <br> 
　Upload virtual spaces, games and creations developed with Unity or UnrealEngine <br> 


##### How will the funds raised by DEV protocol be used? <br/>

We will use the funds for the following purposes <br/>
　(1) Securing human resources <br/>
　(2) Legal and accounting <br/>
　(3) Development costs for the Conata service. <br/>
　
Particularly, item (3) is important because NFT lacks use cases that show how it can be used in reality. NFT is lacking in use cases. <br/>
Although we cannot generate short-term profits, we recognize that this is an activity that is essentially required. <br/>


## Co-creating a virtual culture
Conata is not just a service, it's entertainment. <br/>
Why don't we work together to create Asia's largest imaginary virtual city? <br/>
